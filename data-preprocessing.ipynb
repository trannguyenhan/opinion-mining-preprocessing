Our family of 4 with two teens included have now been to all parks apart from Tokyo. Our least favourite park was HongKong in fact it was the bottom of our list by a long way. We disliked the food that may have been the fact that we prefer western style food. The small amount of western food available was poorly done in fact my daughter fed most of hers to the birds. The park itself was clean and pretty but small and the staff lacked personality. The castle was small and I felt lacked the feeling you get from the other parks. We did enjoy the Mystic manor and was my favourite ride, we also enjoyed the addition of the Disney characters in its a small world but apart from that we were disappointed with the rides. My children said space mountain was the worst one in all the parks they had visited. The merchandise available was also boring and lacked variety compared to other parks. If this is to be your first time at a Disney park dont bother save for a little longer and go to one of the better parks.
